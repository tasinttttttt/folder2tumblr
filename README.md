folder2tumblr
=============

Uploads images from folder to tumblr.
Works with python2

## What it does
Provided a tumblog name, a folder path and a post state, this script uploads the image content of the folder to the specified tumblog.

It records every successful upload in a JSON file so that it won't reupload it again, and to keep track of what you have uploaded.

The first launch setups a prompt to create the necessary tokens, they are saved in a file for subsequent calls.

Also, the posts are dated with the image creation date.
